Just copy bin/fpp wherever you want, e.g. to /usr/local/bin
and you are done.

But if you want to use arch/ and lib/ from this repo without
-A / -I you can do one of the following:

	- do nothing and use /path/to/fpp-repo/bin/fpp

	- add /path/to/fpp-repo/bin/ to $PATH

	- create a symlink to bin/fpp, e.g.
	  ln -s /path/to/fpp-repo/bin/fpp /usr/local/bin/fpp
