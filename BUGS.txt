- Lack of documentation / examples.

- Incomprehensible error messages.

  When fpp detects an error it simply dies with an unclear message.
  Well, otoh, faust does the same ;)

- fpp_import() doesn't work correctly if used in .lib accessed via
  fpp_library(). FIXME.

- Preprocessor directives can't be used in the 'exec' zone.

- FPP functions can't be used in rdtable / rwtable.

- fpp was written with '-lang c' in mind, but I never really tested
  this mode.

- fpp should probably also work on non-Linux platforms, but I didn't
  check.

- This code has been extensively rewritten recently, so there may be
  new bugs that I am not aware of.
